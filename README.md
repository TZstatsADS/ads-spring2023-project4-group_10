+ Project summary: We undertook a project where we independently studied and implemented two algorithms - the Fairness-aware Classifier with Prejudice Remover Regularizer (PR) and Information Theoretic Measures for Fairness-aware Feature selection (FFS). The PR algorithm extends the logistic regression model with a no indirect prejudice condition to mitigate indirect prejudice. On the other hand, the FFS algorithm provides a framework for feature selection that prioritizes fairness considerations.
